To add a bunch of IP addresses to a network connection
without having to type each one in individually

Create a batch file like the below:

netsh in ip add address "Local Area Connection" 10.0.0.2 255.0.0.0
netsh in ip add address "Local Area Connection" 10.0.0.3 255.0.0.0
netsh in ip add address "Local Area Connection" 10.0.0.4 255.0.0.0
netsh in ip add address "Local Area Connection" 10.0.0.5 255.0.0.0
netsh in ip add address "Local Area Connection" 10.0.0.6 255.0.0.0
[...]
netsh in ip add address "Local Area Connection" 10.0.0.226 255.0.0.0

 

or just do a command like

 

for  /L %a in (1,1,254) do netsh in ip add address "Local Area Connection" 10.0.0.%a 255.255.255.0
